# FeatureFile2Fibery
A tool for extracting Test Cases, and Steps ready to be entered into Fibery 

## Overview

`Gherkin2Fibery.py` is a Python script that parses Gherkin feature files and converts their content into a CSV format. This tool extracts features, scenarios, and steps from Gherkin files and organises them into a structured CSV file ready to be uploaded to Fibery.

## Features

- Parses Gherkin feature files to extract features, scenarios, and steps.
- Handles `Feature:`, `Scenario:`, `Scenario Outline:`, and `Developer Task:` lines.
- Includes scenarios and developer tasks even if they don't have steps.
- Generates a CSV file with the extracted data.
- Checks the formatting of the feature file and reports any formatting errors.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

1. Place your Gherkin feature file in the same directory as `Gherkin2Fibery.py` or provide the full path to the feature file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Gherkin2Fibery.py`.
4. Run the script with the following command:

   ```sh
   python Gherkin2Fibery.py <feature_file_path>
   ```

5. After the script checks the formatting and parses the feature file, it will prompt you to confirm whether you want to continue and write the CSV file. Type `yes` to proceed or `no` to cancel the operation.

### Configuration Management

The script now uses a `Config` class to manage file paths and command-line arguments. This class is defined in the `config.py` file.

### Example

```python
from config import Config

config = Config()
feature_file_path = config.get_feature_file_path()
output_csv_path = config.get_output_csv_path()
```

### Running the Inspection Script

1. Place your Gherkin feature file in the same directory as `inspectFeature.py` or provide the full path to the feature file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `inspectFeature.py`.
4. Run the script with the following command:

   ```sh
   python inspectFeature.py <feature_file_path>
   ```

5. The script will display a summary of any formatting errors or syntax issues found in the feature file. It will also handle non-numeric characters in error messages to avoid the ValueError.

### New Behavior of `inspectFeature.py`

The `inspectFeature.py` script has been updated to find lines close to the target Gherkin syntax and ask the user for confirmation. It updates the original file with the new changes and parses the file again. If there are no more errors, the script returns a message indicating the feature file is clean.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the functions in `Gherkin2Fibery.py`, you can use the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest Gherkin2Fibery.py
```

To run the unit tests specified in the `UnitTests.feature` file, you can use the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "UnitTests.feature"
```

To run the new test files that use `io.StringIO` for in-memory file-like objects, you can use the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

### Running Test Files

The test files are located in the `tests` directory and contain test cases derived from `unittest.TestCase`. To run the test files using `unittest` and the `discover` command, use the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

The test files included are:
- `tests/test_csv_writer.py`
- `tests/test_format_checker.py`
- `tests/test_parser.py`

These test files are now linked and included in the main codebase for automated testing or continuous integration.

## Additional Files

- `gherkin_parser.py`: Contains the function to parse Gherkin feature files.
- `csv_writer.py`: Contains the function to write parsed data to a CSV file.
- `format_checker.py`: Contains the function to check the formatting of the feature file.
- `config.py`: Contains the `Config` class to manage file paths and command-line arguments.
